## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **📱 App Runtime Issues**

**Problem: App crashes on startup**
**Solutions:**
- **Clear app data** and restart
- **Check device storage** - ensure sufficient space
- **Update to latest version** of the app
- **Check error logs** in Settings > Crash Reporting
- **Try creating new world** to test basic functionality

**Problem: AI features not working**
**Solutions:**
- **Check internet connection** - **All AI features require internet** (except local providers)
- **Verify API keys** in Settings > AI Providers  
- **Try different AI provider** - 15+ providers available
- **Check free tier limits** - some providers have daily/monthly quotas
- **Use local AI** (Ollama, LM Studio) - runs offline after initial setup

**Problem: Data not saving**
**Solutions:**
- **Check device storage** - ensure sufficient space available
- **Try manual export** to test if data persistence works
- **Restart app** - force close and reopen
- **Clear browser cache** (web version only)
- **Check app permissions** for storage access

**Problem: Performance issues**
**Solutions:**
- **Reduce world size** - export and split large worlds
- **Clear app cache** periodically
- **Close other apps** to free up memory

- **Wait for sync** - first sync can take several minutes
- **Check world list** - scroll down, worlds may be at bottom
- **Import backup** - if you have exported JSON files, use Import feature

**Problem: App taking up too much storage**
**Solutions:**
